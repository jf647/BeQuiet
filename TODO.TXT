PlayerMenu Integration
----------------------

From WowInterface comments:

I'd like to add this addon as an option to the addon PlayerMenu. That way I can right-click on a name in chat and choose BeQuiet instead of the standard ignore. Would you know the syntax for having one script call another so I could hack PlayerMenu to call BeQuiet with the two necessary parameters of 'add' and name? Is this even possible? Thanks!
